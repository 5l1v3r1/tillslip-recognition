# Tillslip recognition with React Native and Expo

> A Google Vision implementation to read tillslips and determine what the total price is

## Caveats

> This solution only works for South African tillslip formats in Rand.

> It is by no means a 100% complete solution, there are many types of tillslips that have not been tested for

## Installation

>This project requires expo to run. You can get it [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation).

## Starting the project


`npm run start`

or if you're using yarn

`yarn start`
